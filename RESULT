weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99     11220

These results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well across all metrics. With an overall accuracy of 99%, the model demonstrates a high ability to correctly classify both true and fake news articles. The precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes are all very high, confirming that the model is effective in minimizing both false positives and false negatives.

Conclusion:
This project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of detecting fake news with an impressive accuracy of 99%. The results highlight the model's robustness in handling real-world datasets and its potential to be deployed as a tool to combat the spread of misinformation. With its high precision and recall, the model is capable of accurately identifying both true and fake news articles, making it a reliable resource for news classification.
